              Hi there! My name is Kevin Lan and I am a current junior attending San Marino High School.
              I am interested in all things computer science and technology. Some of my endeavors include
              competitive programming, web development, and machine learning/data science. 
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Aside from CS, I participate in math team, SciOly, USABO, USNCO, USACO, FRC Robotics, Investmore Club, just
              to name a few scholastic activities. I also helped co-found Project Edge, a student led educational 
              initiative that aims to provide free, personalized education to all. Another huge part of my life has been
              badminton. I have been playing competitively for over 8 years and I have garnered accolades from winning tournaments far
              and wide. Through badminton, I was not only able to learn important skills such as perseverance and sportsmanship, but also
              meet some amazing people who are the closest of my friends to this day.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Some of my hobbies include playing VALORANT (although I am not too good at it), making random projects, watching anime (Attack on Titan is my favorite to date)
              and going on long bike trips with my friends.
